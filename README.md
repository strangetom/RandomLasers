**[1 Febrary](#1-february)**  

___________
# 1 February  
Update  
* Boundary conditions fixed, makes no difference at this time.  
* IPython notebook examples makes sense, suspect problem with parameters of our calcalation.  
*  Lagendijk finite difference method isn't Crank Nicolson since the 2nd order space dereivate is independent of time. It maybe be worth looking at implementing their method on Tuesday (it would highlight any problems with my code.)  
* Boost and lapack are installed (on laptop and netbook). It's going to be a faff to translate the python code into C++.  
  
  

# 29 January  
Thoughts for before Tuesday  
* Go through IPython notebook example fully  
* Use finite difference method as detailed in paper by Wiersma & Lagendijk  
* Look into doing this in C++: Boost library, lapack etc.  
* Fix boundary conditions
